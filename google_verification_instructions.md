# Google Search Console Verification

## Method 1: HTML File Upload (Recommended)
1. Google will give you a file like: `google1234567890abcdef.html`
2. Download that file
3. Upload it to your static folder: `/static/google1234567890abcdef.html`
4. We'll create a route for it

## Method 2: DNS Verification (Alternative)
If you have access to GoDaddy DNS:
1. Add TXT record to revmark.shop DNS
2. Use the verification code Google provides

## Method 3: HTML Meta Tag (Backup)
Add to base.html head section:
`<meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE" />`

Once you get the verification file from Google, let me know and I'll add the route for it!
