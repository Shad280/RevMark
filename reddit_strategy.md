## üìù Content Templates Ready to Post

### Post 1: r/entrepreneur (Tomorrow)
**Title:** "Built a reverse marketplace where buyers post requests - learned some interesting things about customer acquisition"

**Content:**
"Hey r/entrepreneur,

Been working on RevMark (revmark.shop) - a platform where instead of sellers posting services, buyers post what they need and providers compete for the business.

**The concept:** Tired of scrolling through endless Upwork/Fiverr profiles? Post your specific request and let qualified people come to you.

**What I've learned so far:**
- Market validation is everything - started with freelancers but realized local services have huge potential too
- SEO setup is critical from day one (just got Google/Bing crawling)
- Social proof matters more than perfect features

**Currently targeting:**
- Freelance services (design, dev, writing)
- Local services (repairs, cleaning, tutoring)  
- Specialty items (vintage finds, custom products)
- B2B solutions (bulk orders, consulting)

**Questions for the community:**
1. What's your biggest pain point when hiring freelancers/services?
2. Would you prefer posting what you need vs browsing providers?
3. Any similar platforms you've used successfully?

Happy to share more about the build process or get feedback on the concept!

Not here to spam - genuinely want to build something useful and learn from fellow entrepreneurs."

### Post 2: r/freelancers (Day 3)
**Title:** "New platform specifically for custom requests - could be good for freelancers looking for unique projects"

**Content:**
"Fellow freelancers,

Found (okay, built) something that might interest you - RevMark focuses specifically on custom requests and unique projects.

**How it's different:**
- Clients post specific requests instead of you competing with thousands on generic projects
- Focus on custom/unique work where your skills really shine
- Direct communication with clients who know exactly what they want
- Less competition since it's not flooded with basic "design a logo" posts

**Perfect for:**
- Designers with unique styles
- Developers who like solving specific problems  
- Writers with niche expertise
- Anyone who's tired of generic marketplace competition

**Example requests I'm seeing:**
- Custom app with specific functionality
- Logo design for very particular industry
- Content writing for unique subject matter
- Technical consulting for specific tools

The platform is revmark.shop - still growing the user base but the quality of requests is promising.

**Questions:**
- What's your biggest frustration with current freelance platforms?
- Do you prefer competing for specific requests vs general service listings?
- What would make a freelance platform ideal for you?

Would love feedback from the community!"

### Post 3: r/smallbusiness (Day 5)
**Title:** "Platform for finding specialized local services - thought small business owners might find it useful"

**Content:**
"Small business owners,

Built something that might help with finding specialized services - RevMark (revmark.shop).

**The problem it solves:** Ever need something specific for your business but struggle to find the right provider? Instead of searching through hundreds of service listings, you post exactly what you need.

**Great for:**
- Custom equipment repairs
- Specialized cleaning services  
- Unique marketing needs
- Technical consulting
- Custom manufacturing/products
- Local service providers

**How it works:**
1. Post your specific business need
2. Qualified local providers respond with proposals
3. Compare offers and choose the best fit
4. Direct communication throughout

**Example business requests:**
- "Need custom software integration for my POS system"
- "Looking for eco-friendly commercial cleaning in [city]"
- "Custom branded merchandise for upcoming trade show"
- "Specialized equipment maintenance for [industry]"

**Benefits for small businesses:**
- Save time vs searching/calling providers
- Get multiple competitive quotes
- Find specialists for unique needs
- Support other local businesses

Would love feedback from other small business owners - what specialized services are hardest to find in your area?"
