## 🔴 Reddit Launch Strategy (u/revmarkadmin)

### r/entrepreneur Post
**Title:** "Built a marketplace for custom requests - connecting unique needs with skilled providers"

**Post:**
Hey r/entrepreneur!

I wanted to share a project I've been working on - RevMark, a marketplace specifically for custom requests.

**The Problem:** Ever needed something specific that you just can't find anywhere? Maybe a custom logo, specialized service, unique product, or local help with something particular?

**The Solution:** RevMark connects people who need custom work with providers who can deliver it. Think Upwork meets Craigslist, but focused entirely on custom/unique requests.

**How it works:**
- Post your custom request (what you need, budget, timeline)
- Providers submit proposals 
- You choose the best fit
- Direct communication and completion

**Target markets:**
- Freelancers & creative professionals
- Local service providers
- Small businesses offering specialized services
- Anyone with unique skills

Currently live at revmark.shop - would love feedback from fellow entrepreneurs on the concept and execution!

**Questions for the community:**
- What custom requests have you struggled to fulfill?
- Any features you'd want to see in a platform like this?

Happy to answer any questions about the build process or business model!
